# StillUntitledGame

A side project game I am working on outside of my university studies.

Note that that game is currently not an executable application. The game must be run directly using an IDE or however else you want to go about it.

The game does not yet have a premise or story. It doesn't even have any gameplay functionality. I am currently in the process of building (more like learning how to) build a GUI for the game. I am also working to get an initial quest and a basic save system implimented.

Due to the learn-as-I-go nature of this project, the code, especially in the UserInterface Class, is a bit cumbersome and messy. I am hoping to have it cleaned up by April, 2021. Midterms and assignments permitting.

# StillUntitledGame

A side project game I am working on outside of my university studies.

Note that that game is currently not an executable application. The game must be run directly using an IDE or however else you want to go about it. The game can be launched by running the MainGame.java class file found in package01.

The game does not yet have a premise or story nor does it have much gameplay functionality. I am currently in the process of building (more like learning how to) build a GUI for the game. I am also working to get an initial quest and a basic save system implimented. The old console version with a bit (and I mean a bit) more functionality such as gathering ingredients for potions and the ability to save the game, is in a separate repository on my GitHub called Still Untitled Game 1.0.

Due to the learn-as-I-go nature of this project, the code, especially in the UserInterface Class, is a bit cumbersome and messy. I am hoping to get it cleaned up as I learn more and have the time to get it organized. Midterms and assignments permitting.
